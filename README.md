The game initializes by clicking on the button supplied.
From there, you can press any key within the window (at any time you can click on that button to start the game over)

Any letter you press will either record as a successful letter and fill in part of the blank or count against your tries left. If you guess the word, you will see a message you win.

If you do not guess it in time, you will see a you lose message.

Pressing the button again will give you a new word.
The theme is big ten and pac 12 school mascots (pictures would be input due to winning and losing but the html id tag for the image object wouldn't load before I tried to change it. Dont know enough about the order of operations nor had the time to investigate it.)
