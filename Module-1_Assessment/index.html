            <div class="col-sm-9 ml-auto" style="position:relative;"><a>Ken went to Michigan State University to receive Bachelor's Degrees in Chemical Physics and Advanced Mathematics. He began teaching here as a tutor for the mathematics department as a freshman, tutoring students in classes he never took. This experience garnered a love for learning and relaying that learning to students and peers. This experience also pushed him to pursue higher level learning before returning to a teaching capacity. </a></div>

        <div class="row m-4">
            <div class="col-sm-12">So from there, he went to Graduate School at the University of Arizona and obtained a Master's Degree in Applied Mathematics studying analysis and numerical analysis in the way of finite element theory. There he was afforded the opportunity to learn about asymptotics, the underpinnings of calculus, machine learning and interesting results in distribution theory. All of which he will gladly talk your ear off about for those who may be interested. It was there where he met his lovely wife and her two dogs Jude (golden retriever) and Lucy (labradoodle). Along the way, he has found some more furry friends, namely two more dogs; Arlo (husky mix) and Sir Benjamin Wallace (giant schnauzer/poodle mix), and two donkeys; Hugo and Luna, who have all been waiting for an opportunity to experience al four seasons.

        <div class="row m-4">
            <div class="col-sm-12">During his time in graduate school, he got back into the classroom teaching college algebra, trigonometry, business calculus, and precalculus, as well as being a teaching assistant for first year Math Doctorate classes. Teaching was always a love of his and seeing advanced learning happening live is always a thrill and an excitement. He cannot wait to bring that excitement to Barrie and begin fostering a creative and fun environment, yes, even in a math class.</div>
